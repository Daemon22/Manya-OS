## [1.1.0] — 2024-02-01
### Added
- Expanded test suite from 70 to 271 tests across 16 focused spec files.

  `cortex-facade`.
- Comprehensive error hierarchy tests covering all 12 error classes.
- Logging scrub-metadata tests for sensitive field redaction.
- Config merge-depth tests for retryPolicy and resourceBudget.
- Planner edge-case tests for all strategy types and replan paths.
- ToolRegistry tests for `unregister`, `list`, `newId`, and async handlers.
- Scheduler tests for `all`, `next`, `clear`, dependency satisfaction, and budget checks.
- GoalManager tests for all valid/invalid state transitions, `setPriority`, `delete`, `overdue`.
- ResourceManager tests for `reset`, `setCaps`, `snapshot` copy semantics, and zero-cost tasks.
- WorkflowEngine tests for `abort`, explicit step input, missing next-step, and output recording.
- Retry tests for empty/undefined `retryableErrors`, cause preservation, and attempt-count messages.

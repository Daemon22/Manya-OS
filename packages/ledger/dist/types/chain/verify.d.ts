/**
 * @manya/ledger — chain verification.
 *
 * Verifies the cryptographic integrity of a sequence of ledger events:
 *   1. Each event's `prevHash` MUST equal the previous event's `hash`.
 *   2. Each event's `hash` MUST match a fresh recompute over its signing fields.
 *   3. (Optional) Each event's signature MUST verify against the supplied
 *      `actor → publicKey` map.
 *   4. (Optional, default on) Timestamps MUST be monotonically non-decreasing.
 *   5. (Optional, default on) Sequence numbers MUST be contiguous
 *      (1, 2, 3, ...).

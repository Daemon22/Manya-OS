/**
 * @manya/ledger — Merkle tree.
 *
 * A binary Merkle tree built from leaf hashes using SHA-256, with RFC 6962
 * domain separation:
 *   - leaf hash:  `H(0x00 || leaf)`
 *   - inner hash: `H(0x01 || left || right)`
 *
 * Odd-arity handling: when a level has an odd number of nodes, the LAST node
 * is duplicated before pairing (RFC 6962 "duplicate last leaf" strategy).
 *
 * The tree is built eagerly (all intermediate hashes computed at construction
 * time) so subsequent `getProof` calls are O(log n) without re-hashing.

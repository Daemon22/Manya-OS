/**
 * @manya/keyring — Shamir Secret Sharing over GF(2^8).
 *
 * Implements real (k-of-n) secret sharing using the irreducible polynomial
 * 0x11b (AES field polynomial). Each byte of the secret is shared
 * independently: a random polynomial f(x) of degree k-1 with f(0) = secret
 * is generated, and share i = f(i+1).
 *
 * Combine uses Lagrange interpolation at x = 0.
 *
 * Share format: a Buffer of length `1 + secret.length`, where the first byte
 * is the x-coordinate (share id, 1..255) and the remaining bytes are the
 * y-coordinates for each byte-position of the secret.

/**
 * @manya/anonymize — image identifier handling.
 *
 * Images carry several classes of identifiers: EXIF metadata, steganographic
 * watermarks, perceptual hashes, and embedded thumbnails. This module strips
 * known identifier vectors from a buffer representing an image.
 *
 * NOTE: This module operates on raw bytes and does NOT decode pixel data.
 * For full image redaction (face blurring, etc.), pair with a vision library.

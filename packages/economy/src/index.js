/**
 * Manya Economy — Tracks a shared resource budget (tokens, credits, API
 * calls — whatever unit you give it) and enforces it before work happens.
 *
 * Composes three existing Manya tools:
 *   - @manya-os/vault holds the current balance as an encrypted, persistent
 *     value, the same way it holds any other secret or piece of state.
 *   - @manya-os/ledger (itself stamp+unify) records every usage and every
 *     budget-exceeded refusal as a tamper-evident, subscribable event, so
 *     spend can be audited independently of the balance itself.
 *   - @manya-os/memory records the same events episodically, so an agent's
 *     own memory of "what did I spend and why" doesn't require querying
 *     the ledger separately.
 *
 * Economy does not hardcode which model or provider tiers exist — callers
 * supply their own tier map, since that's a fast-moving, deployment-specific
 * detail this package has no business guessing at.
